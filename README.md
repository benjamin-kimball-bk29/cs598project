Please see the .ipynb notebooks above for our modified pyhealth tutorial scripts that demonstrate the results we can find for length-of-stay and mortality metrics. The steps to run the code are layed out in working order there.

These scripts were modified (in order to add one training model to each) from those found under the pyhealth tutorials for LOS and mortality prediction: https://pyhealth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html
